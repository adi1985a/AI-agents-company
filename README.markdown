## üìÑ Overview

**AI OfficeSim: Asynchronous Workplace Simulator** is a Python application designed to model and simulate the dynamics of a modern office environment. It focuses on managing tasks, assigning them to virtual "agents" based on their defined skills and roles, and facilitating inter-agent communication through an asynchronous message bus. Built leveraging Python's `asyncio` library for efficient non-blocking operations, the simulation includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI), provided by an assumed `gui.py` module, for real-time monitoring of task progress, agent activities, and communication logs. This tool can be used to explore workplace dynamics, task delegation, and collaborative workflows.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   üìã **Advanced Task Management**:
    *   Create, assign, and track tasks throughout their lifecycle.
    *   Tasks have defined statuses: `Pending`, `In Progress`, `Blocked`, `Completed`, `Failed`.
    *   Tasks can be assigned priorities: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Critical`.
*   ü§ñ **Intelligent Agent Collaboration**:
    *   Simulates agents (e.g., CEO, Data Analyst, Research Specialist) with predefined roles, a set of skills, and potentially distinct personalities or working styles.
    *   Agents autonomously process assigned tasks based on their capabilities.
*   üó£Ô∏è **Asynchronous Communication Bus**:
    *   Enables message passing between agents for task coordination, information sharing, or delegation.
    *   Utilizes `asyncio` for non-blocking, efficient communication flow.
*   üñ•Ô∏è **Real-Time GUI Monitoring (via `gui.py`)**:
    *   A visual interface (implementation assumed in `gui.py`) allows users to:
        *   Monitor the status and progress of all tasks.
        *   Observe the activities of individual agents.
        *   View a log of communications exchanged on the message bus.
*   üß† **Skill-Based Task Assignment**:
    *   The system can automatically assign newly created or delegated tasks to the most suitable agent(s) based on the skills required for the task versus the skills possessed by the agents.

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots (Conceptual)

_This section would ideally show screenshots of the GUI provided by `gui.py`, displaying: the task board with different statuses, an agent activity log, the communication bus messages, and how tasks are assigned._

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

*   **Python Version**: Python 3.8 or higher (due to the use of `asyncio` features and modern syntax).
*   **Standard Python Libraries**:
    *   `asyncio` (for asynchronous operations)
    *   Other standard libraries as needed by `main.py` (e.g., `random`, `time`, `collections`).
*   **GUI Module (`gui.py`)**:
    *   A Python file named `gui.py` **must be present** in the project directory.
    *   This module is assumed to provide a function, likely named `run_gui()`, which launches and manages the graphical interface. The specific GUI library used (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy, CustomTkinter) would be defined within `gui.py`.
*   **Libraries for `gui.py`**: Depending on the chosen GUI framework in `gui.py`, additional libraries might need to be installed (e.g., `pip install PyQt5`). This README assumes `gui.py` itself handles its own dependencies or they are standard.

## üß© Core GUI Module (`gui.py`)

The functionality and appearance of the simulation's visual monitoring aspects are entirely dependent on the **user-provided or project-included `gui.py` module**.

*   It must contain a callable function, typically `run_gui()`, which is invoked by `main.py` (often in a separate thread or managed by `asyncio` to run alongside the simulation logic).
*   This module is responsible for creating all visual elements: windows, task displays, agent status indicators, message logs, etc.
*   It needs to interface with the simulation logic in `main.py` to receive real-time updates about tasks, agents, and messages to reflect them in the UI.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` with your specific details).*

2.  **Ensure `gui.py` is Present**:
    *   Place your `gui.py` file (containing the `run_gui` function and its associated GUI logic) in the root project directory alongside `main.py`.

3.  **Install GUI Dependencies (if any for `gui.py`)**:
    *   If `gui.py` uses external libraries not part of standard Python (e.g., PyQt5, Kivy), install them using pip:
        ```bash
        # Example if gui.py uses PyQt5
        # pip install PyQt5
        ```

4.  **Run the Application**:
    Open a terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory and execute:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## üí° Usage Guide

1.  Ensure all setup steps, including providing `gui.py` and installing its dependencies, are completed.
2.  Launch the application by running `python main.py` from your terminal.
3.  **Simulation Dynamics**:
    *   The simulation will initialize with predefined agents (e.g., a boss like Eleanor Wells, and team members such as David Chen, Maria Rodriguez).
    *   Tasks can be introduced into the system (either programmatically within `main.py` or potentially via a GUI interaction if `gui.py` supports it).
    *   Tasks are automatically delegated by agents (e.g., the boss) to other agents based on their skill sets.
    *   Agents "process" tasks, which might involve simulated delays (e.g., random 1-3 seconds as per notes) to mimic work.
    *   Agents communicate with each other via the message bus to coordinate on tasks, request information, or report progress.
4.  **GUI Monitoring**:
    *   The GUI window (launched by `run_gui` from `gui.py`) will display real-time information:
        *   **Task Board/List**: Shows all tasks with their current statuses (Pending, In Progress, Blocked, Completed, Failed) and priorities.
        *   **Agent Activity Log**: May show what each agent is currently working on or their status (e.g., Idle, Working, Blocked).
        *   **Communication Log**: Displays messages exchanged between agents on the communication bus.
    *   Observe how tasks are assigned, progress, and how agents collaborate.
5.  The simulation runs until explicitly stopped (if such a feature is built into the GUI or `main.py`) or when all tasks are completed, or as defined by the simulation's end conditions.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure (Expected)

*   `main.py`: The main Python script containing the core simulation logic, agent definitions, task management system, communication bus implementation, and the invocation of the GUI.
*   `gui.py`: (**User-provided or project-included**) The Python module responsible for creating and managing the Graphical User Interface for monitoring the simulation.
*   `README.md`: This documentation file.

*(No external data files like `.txt` or database files are mentioned for persistence in the provided description, implying an in-memory simulation.)*

## üìù Technical Notes

*   **`gui.py` Dependency**: The entire visual aspect of the simulation hinges on the `gui.py` module. Without a functional `gui.py` providing `run_gui()`, the simulation might run headless or fail to start if `main.py` strictly expects the GUI.
*   **Simulated Task Processing**: Task completion is currently simulated with random delays. In a more advanced version, this could be replaced with actual computational work or integration with external systems.
*   **In-Memory Data**: All simulation data (tasks, agent states, messages) is held in memory. For persistence across sessions or larger simulations, integrating a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) or file-based saving/loading would be necessary.
*   **`asyncio` for Concurrency**: The use of `asyncio` is key for managing multiple agents, tasks, and communications concurrently without traditional multi-threading complexities, allowing for a responsive simulation.
*   **Scalability**: The current design's scalability would depend on the efficiency of the `asyncio` event loop, the complexity of agent logic, and the performance of the `gui.py` updates.
